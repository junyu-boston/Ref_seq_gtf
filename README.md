# Ref_seq_gtf
Generate genome annotation gtf file for NCBI refseq

I plan to run salmon on my DNA-seq data to get the transcripts abundance. I want to have Refseq version. 

I found the information here: 
https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/2548/hg38-gtf-file-with-refseq-annotations

I will try it.
